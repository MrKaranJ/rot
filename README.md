The use of ROT Ciphers has been prevalent in human society and it is one of the widely known encryption techniques. It is a based on shifting the alphabet by N places to encode the text and backshifting the text by n places to decode the text.

This simple program has two functions that encode and decode based on the number of shifts required from 1 to 25 and takes any text and provides the encoded or decoded text as required.

Copy the functions 'rot' and 'derot' to use as required and test the functions by running 'main.py'.
